Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

Example 1:
Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8.
Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

// ======================== SOLUTION 1 ========================
// Time Complexity:

var isValidSudoku = function (board) {
    let rows = Array.from({ length: 9 }, () => new Set());
    let cols = Array.from({ length: 9 }, () => new Set());
    let boxes = Array.from({ length: 9 }, () => new Set());

    for (let r = 0; r < 9; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < 9; c++) {
            if (board[r][c] === ".") {
                continue;
            }

            let value = board[r][c];
            let boxIndex = Math.floor(r / 3) * 3 + Math.floor(c / 3);

            if (
                rows[r].has(value) ||
                cols[c].has(value) ||
                boxes[boxIndex].has(value)
            ) {
                return false;
            }

            rows[r].add(value);
            cols[c].add(value);
            boxes[boxIndex].add(value);
        }
    }

    return true;
};
